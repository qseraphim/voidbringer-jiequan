# Jiequan, the Bringer of Void

A vastly more difficult rework of Jiequan's fight. Includes a third phase, custom attack weights, a new feint move, new conditions, aggressive speed-ups that require the player to stay locked in and a unique challenge mode.

With a heavy hint of Promised Eigong design philosophy but taken a few notches further with difficulty and meta jade setup variety, Void Jiequan shall be my *real* debut Nine Sols mod. Lvl 0 beatability has not been kept in mind when designing the boss.

## Current changes and new additions (v1.0.0)

### Universal changes
- Damage received from most of Jiequan's attacks is increased by 50%
- Crimson Smash is now an instant kill on hit (though Revival Jade can prevent that)
- Crimson Smash now has a 30% chance to be interrupted and followed up with an instant Horizontal Thrust instead.
- Similarly, with the same 30% chance, Daggers can also fake out, into one of two equally likely attacks: Teleport, Crimson Thrust
- Crimson Thrust can now, with a 30% chance, fake out into Teleport (This, with the above change, can result in consecutive fakeouts)
- Jiequan can no longer be staggered by any means. This causes a few interactions to now happen:
  - Crimson Smash now always spawns fire columns and trails regardless of whether or not is is countered
  - Using Unbounded Counter against Crimson Thrust no longer stuns Jiequan
  - Breaking the shield no longer stuns Jiequan and no longer interrupts his healing
  - Cloud Piercer and 5 Qi Full Control detonations no longer briefly stun him
- The following attacks have been sped up as follows:
  - Double Slash is 70% faster
  - Daggers is 70% faster (Projectile speed unchanged)
  - Diagonal Thrust is 80% faster
  - Plunge is 70% faster
  - Crimson Smash is 80% faster
  - Stab is 70% faster
  - Grenades is 70% faster (Again, projectile speed unchanged)
  - Shield is 100% faster
  - Teleport is 200% faster
  - Horizontal Thrust is 80% faster
  - Crimson Thrust is 70% faster
- A brand new third phase has been added with custom attack weights

### Phase 1 changes
